I hear a lot about self-attention in papers I read every now and then. And almost every time i get very puzzeled whenever the word is mentioned. Whether it is action recognition, image translation, image segementation or anything else (PS: sorry for being computer vision bias), self-attention is the new trend, I suppose. 

So, I decided to finally learn and post about it as I go. 

Lets say you have a time series data. It is in their nature to be very noisy. And believe me when I say this. How ? Read my recent paper - <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=pM6-D7EAAAAJ&citation_for_view=pM6-D7EAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C"><b>Predicting gaze from egocentric social interaction videos and IMU data</b></a>
